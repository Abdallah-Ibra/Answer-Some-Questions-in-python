# Answer Some Questions in python

## Answer some questions and tricks in python


### Question (1)

Write python code that takes three inputs from the user and prints its mean (sum / number of entries)

 For example if the entries are 50, 60 and 70 averages are (50 + 60 + 70) / 3 60 scales

 Write a program that takes 3 inputs average the three values

 For example, if the entries were 50, 60, and 70, the average would be 3, which equals 60


### Question(2)

Write a program that takes a tag from the user and prints for him the evaluation of this mark according to the attached table

 For example, if the user entered his mark 50, he would print an F

 If he entered 80, he would print with-

 If he entered 150, he prints an invalid mark

 Invalid mark> 100 or negative
 A + 97 - 100%
 A 93-96%
 A 90 - 92%
 B + 87 - 89%
 B 83 - 86%
 B 80 - 82%
 C + 77 - 79%
 C 73-76%
 C- 70 - 72%
 D + 67 - 69%
 D 63 - 66%
 D- 60 - 62%
 F 0 - 59%


### Question(3)

  Write a function that takes a set of values ​​into a list (array) and returns the largest value in it

 Write a function that takes a set of values ​​into a list (array) and returns its smallest value

 Write a function that takes a set of values ​​in a list (array) and returns the sum of the values ​​in it

 Write a function that takes a set of values ​​in (an array) and returns the median of values ​​in it

 Then write another function that calls the last function and increase the mean by 10%

 Then write another function that recalls all the functions above
